Design Grade:- B
Correctness Score:- 15/15
TA Comments on Design:-
- Sometimes bigbang run doesn't display lines(joining node to grandparent) after node deletion
- Node has unnecessary attribute Parent which is empty list
- No invariant on Parent's interpretation 
- No generalization for sqaure and circle: redundant code at multiple places
- any-shape-selected? should have better name and returns statement: should have had node instead of shape
- add-shape-to-selected-shapes has a contract violation
- add-child condition check just had effect on posn-x so it should be just for that
- handle-deletion-of-root-node wrong design receipe 
- change-parent wrong contarct: parent is of type Tree
